# Bio
My name is Leah Cass and I am a senior at George Washington University double majoring in environmental studies and biology. I am primarily interested in research focused on wildlife conservation. I have contributed to conservation research for species of all sizes from human-elephant conflict mitigation in Tanzania to the effects of pesticides on pollinators in Washington, D.C. I plan to use my background in ecology and ecosystem science to continue work researching, developing, and implementing conservation solutions.
